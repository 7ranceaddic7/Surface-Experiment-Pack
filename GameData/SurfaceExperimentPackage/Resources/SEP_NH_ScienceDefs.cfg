		ErnusSrfLanded = The sun's gravity is strongly in effect here.

		DersoSrfLanded = You are distracted by a beautiful hurricane on Laythe, and plug in a cable backwards. No data.
		
		ApturSrfLanded = You can see Kerbin's gravity every time it swings past.
		
		NolasSrfLanded = There are a lot of different mass concentrations below the surface.
		
		LeouchSrfLanded = Mass concentrations are all over the place. Stable orbits will be hard to find.
		
		TitanusSrfLanded = The detector almost crushes itself from its own weight.
		
        EteSrfLanded = Gravity? What gravity?

    {
		ErnusSrfLanded = The gravitational field changes as the lava flows.
		ErnusSrfLanded = You can detect Kerbol's gravity quite easily.
		
    	ArinSrfLanded = The rings actually have a noticeable gravitational pull of their own.
    	ArinSrfLanded = The gravitational effects here are interesting.
		
		AstidSrfLanded = The gravity is boring.
		AstidSrfLanded = This seems to be a peaceful place, where up is up and down is down. No sideways gravity to be found.
		
		DersoSrfLanded = The gravity is definitely uneven.
		DersoSrfLanded = You are distracted by a beautiful hurricane on Laythe, and plug in a cable backwards. No data.
		
		ApturSrfLanded = The gravitational field shows a definite influence from Kerbin whenever it passes by.

		TitanusSrfLanded = The detector almost crushes itself from its own weight.
		TitanusSrfLanded = It is really, really hard to measure the gravity here.
		
        EteSrfLanded = Gravity? What gravity?
        EteSrfLanded = Since the rings weigh more than this moon in total, they produce some notable effects.
		
		OreeSrfLanded = The graph is somewhat distorted by the mass of your lander.
		OreeSrfLanded = The graph is somewhat distorted by the mass of your lander.

		TidusSrfLanded = The play of the tidal forces is fascinating to watch. 
		
		EtalSrfLanded = The gravity here is - intresting.
		EtalSrfLanded =	The gravity scans here confirm a a highly porus surface of remarkably dense material.
